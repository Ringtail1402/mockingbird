* Looser coupling for Anthem services.  Do not pass around entire
  Application object whenever possible.  Use event mechanism.
* Streamline configuration (but keep it based on plain PHP)
* Cache component for caching of configuration and arbitrary stuff
* Add support for minification and versioning to AssetHelpers
* Other features:
  - Unit tests, at least for service classes
  - Bring back in-line editing
  - Better README
  - Split L10n module from core.
  - CalendarAdminPage (Table + selection by calendar)
  - PropelTreeAdminPage (Table + tree view)
  - Files (File library, with inputs w/ajax upload, easy binding to models,
    virtual directory structure, TinyMCE integration)
  - Search (using something like Sphinx or Lucene)
